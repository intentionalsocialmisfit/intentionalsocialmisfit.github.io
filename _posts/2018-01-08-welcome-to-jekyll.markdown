Hallelujah we can finally hear  
It's a miracle we feel anything at all  
Things we planted on the worst days of the year  
Grow to fingers that rip at the joys and sets our backs against the wall  

Lay your weapons down  
Lay your weapons down  
There are no enemies in front of you  

Hallelujah we can finally see  
How the bitterness was bruising all our skin  
And we didn't notice that grace had run so thin  
Til we're falling apart and the cracks in our hearts let the truth sink in
